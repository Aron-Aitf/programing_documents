# A list of things learned from doing

## Use ORMs not raw SQL:
- #### SQL is hard to maintaining and makes messy code when constructing dynamic queries   
- #### The key is to use a orm like Sea ORM not things like diesel which require mandatory CLI tools
- #### query builders are acceptable but often a ORM is better

## Avoid many files and folders in python:
- #### python imports ade messy and hard to deal with
- #### so just minimize files
- #### folders are even worse and are the main problem with python imports
- #### this does not apply to rust
