# A list of things learned from doing

## Use ORMs not raw SQL:

- ### SQL is hard to maintaining and makes messy code when constructing dynamic queries

- ### The key is to use a ORM

- ### query builders are acceptable but often a ORM is better

- ### This only applies to python, in rust SQLx is better

## Avoid many files and folders in python:

- ### Python imports are messy and hard to deal with

- ### so just minimize files

- ### Folders are even worse and are the main problem with python imports

- ### This does not apply to rust

## APIs are not easy to make in rust:

- ### In rust api are challenging to make

- ### Databases are difficult but somewhat easier

- ### Instead of APIs make CLIs
