# Text snippets

- ### Describe or solve an algorithm in a formal manner. That is, write a proof, justify why it works, or its time complexity. This is rarely, needed, but having the ability to be able to read, understand, and sometimes derive these is important

- ### There is a lot of cool techniques in papers, or tiny blogs, or GDC slides describing the applications from industry / academia

- ### Multiple languages (including ones you would not think relevant). (C, Lisp, Prolog, Python, assembler, C++, and Smalltalk)

- ### Multiple AI concepts

- ### Deep explanation of the electrical part of computer (how the processor, the ram, the buses works with diagrams)

- ### How to write a compiler (C) and an interpreter (Lisp)

- ### Parallelism (not only multithreading but work on multiple machines in a network)

- ### Networking concepts thoroughly

- ### All the rather boring parts you would not spend too much time on your own but are actually useful (Data Structures, Big O notation)

- ### Algorithms: Backtracking, width vs depth search and A*-style stuff, ordering algorithms, etc

- ### Algorithm complexity (O(1), O(n), and the like), to understand why your stuff goes SO slowly

- ### Design Patterns: They're a must in OOP

- ### Graph Theory may be handy in very specific situations. Also a decent knowledge in maths doesn't hurt

- ### Cryptography: The most obvious. Also it doesn't hurt to know what a hashing function is, specially because you may use hash tables

- ### Machine code and how everything works underneath the surface, the stack, local variables, dynamic memory allocation, etc

- ### Graduate level statistics, machine learning algorithms, deep learning and a lot more. Theory heavy stuff
